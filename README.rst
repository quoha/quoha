Quoha
=====

Quoha is a framework for static websites.

It is not intended as a replacement for any existing scripting
language (or compiled language, for that matter). Instead, it
is offered as a different take on working with templates.

If you love it and think that it will work for you, then welcome
to the Quoha community!

If not, there are thousands of other applications for you to choose
from. Keep searching until you find the perfect match for you. It
it out there, somewhere.

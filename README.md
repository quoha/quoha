Quoha
=====

Quoha is a scripting language inspired by ferite and written in Go.

It started life as a templating system for static web sites. It
didn't take long to realize that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) did an
excellent job of that.

If you love it and think that it will work for you, then welcome
to the Quoha community!

If not, there are thousands of other applications for you to choose
from. Keep searching until you find the perfect match for you. It
is out there, somewhere.
